# Inferno: A Short Tutorial

Inferno is a utility library built around [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), designed to help you train and even build complex pytorch models. And in this tutorial, we'll see how! If you're new to PyTorch, I highly recommended you work through the [Pytorch tutorials](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/) first.
